## Installing miniconda on Mac

This guide is focused on how to install the miniconda package on a Mac.

**Background:**
[Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io) has developed the Anaconda package management system for Python. This is a powerful tool that allows users to install packages easily and without root access. It also allows for simple control over virtual environments (called conda envs) that makes dependency resolution for particular software or pipelines a breeze.

The entire Anaconda package is quite large. Rather than installing the whole thing, we will be installing [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Miniconda simply installs Python and the machinery to add additional packages that are enabled in the conda package management system. After we have finished installing miniconda, we will install a couple of useful packages that we plan to use during this workshop.

Navigate to the [miniconda website](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Click on the "64-bit (bash installer)" link underneath "Mac OS X".
